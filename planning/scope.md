# Scope, Purpose, and Audience
## Proposed Scope of Work
* Use of machine learning-based AI to enhance accessibility of Web content, including its application to
   + Code generation
   + Web content creation/authoring tools
   + accessibility evaluation/content remediation
   + Delivery of Web content to users
* Application of machine learning-based AI by users themselves, including
    + Assistive technologies
    + Accessibility-related features of user agents
    + Accessibility-related features of applications (e.g., speech recognition for caption generation in a meeting application)
    + Applications that use machine learning to generate content, especially the accessibility of the content they create

## Purposes
The main purposes of the document are

* Identification of accessibility issues to be considered in the above-mentioned applications
* Identification of existing and applicable W3C accessibility guidance
* Characterization of potential approaches or solutions to the problems described.

## Intended Audience
* Participants in relevant W3C Working Groups, Interest Groups, and Community Groups contributing to specifications, accessibility guidance, or Web technologies connected with machine learning or generative AI.
* Researchers or software developers engaged in the use of these technologies, and who wish to enhance their knowledge of accessibility issues prior to publication of any formal guidance by the W3C or inclusion of accessibility considerations in applicable W3C specifications.
* Developers of applications employing machine learning, including generative AI, seeking to understand accessibility considerations prior to the development of any formal, W3C guidance.
